## HPGrind: Skip all the planning, researching, and evaluation — Just Grind!

**HPGrind calibrates your level of skill and adjusts the questions accordingly, making practice far more efficient and personalized.**

### What makes HPGrind better than all the alternatives?

To answer that, let me list the problems with the alternatives:

1. **All parts weighted equally**: Most alternatives treat all skills as **equally important**, ignoring how often a skill appears on the test. For effective practice, students must figure out what to focus on themselves.
2. **Math teachers' way of doing math**: Understanding the *why* behind math isn't **necessary** for performing on Högskoleprovet. HPGrind uses shortcuts to maximize results.
3. **Speed is not prioritized**: Many students underperform due to the tight time frame. Teaching **slow solutions** sets them up for failure.

### How does HPGrind fix these?

1. **Weighing skills accurately**: HPGrind factors in both skill frequency and student proficiency to make every minute count.
2. **Condensed teaching**: By focusing on essentials, using simple language, and encouraging shortcuts, students learn faster and stress less.
3. **3-level system**: Separates *solving a question* from *solving it fast*. Slow methods are not falsely considered test-ready.
